# KindlyGuard Core - Private Enhanced Library

This is the private core library for KindlyGuard that provides patented lock-free data structures and advanced security algorithms.

## ⚠️ Private Repository

This library contains proprietary technology and should not be distributed publicly.

## Current Status

This directory contains a **stub implementation** for development purposes. The actual proprietary implementation would include:

- **AtomicEventBuffer**: Patented lock-free ring buffer with bit-packed atomic state
- **BinaryProtocol**: Custom binary encoding with compression
- **PatternMatcher**: SIMD-accelerated pattern matching with ML models
- **ThreatClassifier**: Machine learning-based threat classification
- **UnicodeNormalizer**: Advanced unicode threat detection

## Building

```bash
cargo build
```

## Integration

The enhanced features in other KindlyGuard components use this library when the `enhanced` feature is enabled:

```toml
[dependencies]
kindly-guard-core = { path = "../kindly-guard-core", optional = true }

[features]
enhanced = ["kindly-guard-core"]
```

## Components Using This Library

- `kindly-guard-shield`: Uses AtomicEventBuffer, BinaryProtocol, and PatternMatcher
- `kindly-guard-server`: Would use the full suite of enhanced features
