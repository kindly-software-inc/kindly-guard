# Post-Installation Verification Feature

## Overview

I've added comprehensive post-installation verification to `kindly-guard/kindly-tools/src/lib.rs` that automatically runs after each installation method (homebrew, npm, cargo, binary).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Binary Location Check
- Searches expected installation paths based on the method used
- Falls back to `which` command if not found in standard locations
- Shows exactly where the binary was found

### 2. Execution Verification
- Runs `kindlyguard --version` to ensure the binary works
- Displays the version information
- Shows any error messages if execution fails

### 3. File Permissions Check (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- Verifies the binary has executable permissions
- Provides the exact `chmod` command to fix if needed

### 4. PATH Configuration Check
- Detects if the installation directory is in PATH
- Provides shell-specific instructions for:
  - Bash (~/.bashrc)
  - Zsh (~/.zshrc)  
  - Fish (fish_add_path)
  - Generic shells

## Visual Feedback

The verification uses emojis for clear communication:
- üîé Verifying installation...
- ‚úÖ Success indicators for each check
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for non-critical issues (like PATH)
- ‚ùå Failures that need attention
- üí° Helpful tips and commands

## Installation Method Support

### Homebrew/Brew
- Checks: `/usr/local/bin/kindlyguard`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/kindlyguard`
- PATH: Detects ARM64 Macs vs Intel Macs

### NPM
- Dynamically detects npm global prefix
- Checks standard npm binary locations
- Provides npm-specific PATH configuration

### Cargo
- Checks: `~/.cargo/bin/kindlyguard`
- Standard Rust installation paths

### Binary
- Checks multiple possible locations
- Covers manual installations

## MCP Server Verification

Also added verification for MCP server installations:
- Checks if server is configured in MCP config
- Verifies associated CLI tools exist
- Shows configuration status

## Code Changes

### Main Functions Added:
1. `verify_installation(method: &str)` - Main verification logic
2. `detect_and_show_path_instructions(method: &str)` - Shell detection and PATH help
3. `verify_mcp_server_installation(server_name: &str)` - MCP server checks
4. `get_mcp_config_path()` - Moved to global scope for reuse

### Integration Points:
- Called automatically after `install_kindlyguard()`
- Integrated with MCP server installation flow
- Non-blocking warnings vs blocking errors

## Example Output

```
üîé Verifying installation...

üìç Checking binary locations...
   ‚úÖ Found binary at: /usr/local/bin/kindlyguard

üîß Checking binary execution...
   ‚úÖ Binary executes successfully
   üìå Version: kindlyguard 0.10.3

üîê Checking file permissions...
   ‚úÖ Binary has executable permissions

üåê Checking PATH configuration...
   ‚ö†Ô∏è kindlyguard directory not in PATH

üí° To add kindlyguard to your PATH:

   üêö For Zsh:
      1. Add to ~/.zshrc:
         $ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
      2. Reload:
         $ source ~/.zshrc

üìã Verification Summary

‚úÖ Installation succeeded with warnings:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è PATH configuration needed
```

## Benefits

1. **User Confidence** - Users know their installation succeeded
2. **Early Problem Detection** - Catches issues before first use
3. **Actionable Guidance** - Provides exact commands to fix problems
4. **Shell-Aware** - Detects user's shell for accurate instructions
5. **Non-Intrusive** - Warnings don't block, only real failures do

## Testing

Created `/home/samuel/kindly-guard/test_verification.sh` for testing the feature.

The verification ensures users have a working installation and know exactly how to fix any issues!
