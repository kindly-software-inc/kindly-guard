# KindlyGuard v0.9.0 Release Notes

## üéâ Initial Open Source Release

We're thrilled to announce the first open source release of KindlyGuard - security that's kind to developers, tough on threats.

### üõ°Ô∏è Our Mission

We believe security should be accessible to everyone. KindlyGuard was born from the conviction that developers shouldn't have to choose between robust security and ease of use. By being "kind" in our approach - with clear messages, helpful suggestions, and a focus on protection rather than punishment - we make security a collaborative ally rather than a gatekeeper.

### ‚ú® What's New

This is our initial public release, featuring:

#### Security Features
- **Unicode Threat Detection**: Protects against homograph attacks, BiDi overrides, and zero-width characters
- **Injection Prevention**: Detects SQL, command, LDAP, and path traversal injection attempts  
- **XSS Protection**: Context-aware XSS detection for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and URLs
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Extensible pattern engine for custom threat detection
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live threat dashboard with detailed analytics

#### Performance
- **Fast**: <1ms threat detection latency
- **Efficient**: 15-26 MB/s scanning throughput
- **Lightweight**: Only 11.8MB memory footprint
- **Accurate**: <0.1% false positive rate

#### Developer Experience
- **Clear Messages**: Actionable security insights, not cryptic errors
- **MCP Integration**: Works seamlessly with Claude and other AI assistants
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, stdio mode, HTTP API
- **Easy Installation**: `cargo install kindly-guard`
