# Publishing KindlyGuard to Crates.io

This directory contains the minimal placeholder package to reserve the "kindlyguard" name on crates.io.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a crates.io account at: https://crates.io
2. Get your API token from: https://crates.io/me
3. Login locally: `cargo login YOUR_API_TOKEN`

## Publishing Steps

1. Navigate to the package directory:
   ```bash
   cd crates-io-package/kindlyguard
   ```

2. Run the publish script:
   ```bash
   ./publish.sh
   ```

   The script will:
   - Verify you're logged in
   - Run tests
   - Validate the package
   - Do a dry run
   - Publish to crates.io

## Manual Publishing (Alternative)

If you prefer to publish manually:

```bash
cd crates-io-package/kindlyguard
cargo test
cargo publish --dry-run
cargo publish
```

## After Publishing

1. Verify the package at: https://crates.io/crates/kindlyguard
2. The name is now reserved for your account
3. You can update to the full implementation when ready

## Updating to Full Implementation

When ready to release the full KindlyGuard:

1. Update version in Cargo.toml (e.g., to 0.1.0)
2. Replace lib.rs with the actual implementation
3. Update README.md
4. Run `cargo publish` again

## Important Notes

- The package name "kindlyguard" (all lowercase) will be reserved
- Only the account that publishes can update it
- Make sure you're logged in with the "samduchaine" account
- The placeholder is minimal but valid Rust code
