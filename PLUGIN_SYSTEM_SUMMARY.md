# KindlyGuard Plugin System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The plugin system has been successfully implemented following the same trait-based architecture pattern used throughout KindlyGuard. This allows users to extend the security scanner with custom threat detection logic without modifying the core code.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Plugin Trait** (`SecurityPlugin`)
   - Defines the interface all plugins must implement
   - Methods: `metadata()`, `initialize()`, `scan()`, `health_check()`, `shutdown()`
   - Async-first design for scalability

2. **Plugin Manager** (`PluginManagerTrait` + `DefaultPluginManager`)
   - Manages plugin lifecycle (load, unload, reload)
   - Coordinates scanning across all plugins
   - Enforces timeouts and handles errors gracefully
   - Supports allow/deny lists for plugin control

3. **Plugin Loaders**
   - `NativePluginLoader`: Loads Rust-based plugins compiled into the binary
   - `WasmPluginLoader`: (Stub) Would load WebAssembly plugins for sandboxed execution
   - Extensible design allows adding more loaders (e.g., dynamic libraries)

4. **Scanner Integration**
   - `SecurityScanner` now accepts an optional `PluginManagerTrait`
   - Plugins are called after built-in scanners
   - Results are aggregated with proper threat type handling

## Example Plugins

Three example native plugins are included:

1. **SqlInjectionPlugin**
   - Detects SQL injection patterns using regex
   - Demonstrates pattern-based threat detection

2. **XssPlugin**  
   - Detects cross-site scripting attempts
   - Shows how to scan for HTML/JavaScript injection

3. **CustomPatternPlugin**
   - User-configurable pattern matching
   - Illustrates how plugins can accept custom configuration

## Configuration

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = true
plugin_dirs = ["./plugins"]
auto_load = true
allowlist = []  # Empty means all allowed
denylist = []   # Specific plugins to block
max_execution_time_ms = 5000
isolation_level = "none"  # Options: none, standard, strong
```

## Current Limitations

1. **Async Context Issue**: Plugins cannot be called from async contexts (like the CLI) due to runtime-in-runtime restrictions. They work properly when called from sync contexts (like the MCP server).

2. **Dynamic Loading**: Currently only supports plugins compiled into the binary. Dynamic library loading would require additional implementation.

3. **WASM Support**: WebAssembly plugin support is stubbed but not fully implemented.

## Usage

### From MCP Server (works fully)
```rust
let scanner = SecurityScanner::new(config)?;
scanner.set_plugin_manager(plugin_manager);
// Plugins will be called during scan_text() and scan_json()
```

### From CLI (limited - plugins skipped in async context)
```bash
kindly-guard-cli scan file.json --config kindly-guard-plugins.toml
```

## Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: Users can add custom threat detection without forking
2. **Isolation**: Plugin failures don't crash the main scanner
3. **Performance**: Plugins run with timeouts and can be disabled
4. **Flexibility**: Support for different plugin types (native, WASM, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement dynamic library loading for true plugin distribution
2. Complete WASM support for sandboxed plugins
3. Add plugin marketplace/registry support
4. Implement plugin chaining and dependencies
5. Add async scanner methods to support plugins from async contexts
