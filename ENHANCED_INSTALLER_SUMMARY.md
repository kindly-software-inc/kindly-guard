## 🎯 Overview

The KindlyGuard installer has been significantly enhanced with better error handling, visual feedback, and recovery options. The installer now provides a delightful experience even when things go wrong, with intelligent fallbacks and helpful guidance.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. **Platform-Specific Emojis** ✅

Better visual recognition with platform-specific icons:

### 2. **Smart Environment Detection** ✅

Three new detection functions provide contextual awareness:

- 🐳 Docker container detection
- 🖥️ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- 🤖 CI/CD environment
- 🔌 SSH session
- 🏢 Corporate proxy settings

#### `detect_linux_distro()` 
- Reads `/etc/os-release` for exact distribution

- Provides manager-specific commands
- Helps with version conflicts

### 3. **Interactive Recovery Menu** ✅

When installation fails, users see:
```
🚨 Installation failed using npm
🔄 Let's try a different approach...

1️⃣  🔐 Try with sudo
2️⃣  🏠 Install to home directory  
3️⃣  📦 Use different package manager
4️⃣  💿 Download binary directly
5️⃣  📴 Offline installation
6️⃣  🔍 Show diagnostics
7️⃣  ❌ Cancel

Choose recovery method:
```

Each option provides detailed, platform-specific instructions.

### 4. **Post-Installation Verification** ✅

After installation, automatic verification checks:
```
🔎 Verifying installation...
   ✅ Binary found: /usr/local/bin/kindlyguard
   ✅ Version: kindlyguard v0.10.3
