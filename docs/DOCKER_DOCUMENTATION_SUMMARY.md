   - linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Build instructions for each architecture

2. **Security-First Approach**
   - Non-root user (10001:10001)
   - Read-only root filesystem
   - Dropped capabilities
   - Comprehensive secret management
   - Network isolation

3. **Production-Ready Configurations**
   - Health checks
   - Resource limits
   - Logging configurations
   - TLS termination with nginx
   - Kubernetes manifests

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Quick start in 30 seconds

## Integration Points

The Docker documentation integrates with:
- Existing docker-multiplatform-build.md
- Configuration guide (CONFIGURATION.md)
- MCP server setup guide
- Security audit reports

## Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Deploy KindlyGuard with Docker in production
2. Follow security best practices for containerized deployments
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Troubleshoot common issues
5. Optimize performance for their specific use case

The documentation provides a complete path from development to production deployment using Docker.
