# Audit Module Documentation Summary

## Overview
The audit module in `kindly-guard-server/src/audit/mod.rs` has been comprehensively documented with a focus on compliance requirements for security auditors and compliance teams.

## Documentation Added

### 1. Module-Level Documentation
- Overview of supported compliance standards (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001)
- Key features of the audit system
- Usage examples

### 2. AuditSeverity Documentation
Each severity level now includes:
- **When to use**: Specific scenarios for each level
- **Compliance notes**: Which standards require which severity levels
- **Retention requirements**: How long to keep logs at each severity

Severity levels documented:
- `Info`: Routine operations, 30-90 day retention
- `Warning`: Potential issues, 90+ day retention
- `Error`: Operational problems, 1+ year retention
- `Critical`: Security events, 3-7 year retention

### 3. AuditEventType Documentation
Each event type (20+ variants) now includes:
- **Triggered when**: Exact conditions that generate the event
- **Required fields**: Which fields must be populated
- **Additional context**: Optional but recommended data to capture
- **Compliance requirements**: Specific standards that require this event
- **Typical severity**: Expected severity level

Event categories documented:
- Authentication Events (AuthSuccess, AuthFailure)
- Authorization Events (AccessGranted, AccessDenied)
- Security Events (ThreatDetected, ThreatBlocked)
- Neutralization Events (5 variants for threat response)
- Rate Limiting Events
- Configuration Events
- Plugin Events
- System Events
- Custom Events

### 4. AuditLogger Trait Documentation
Comprehensive documentation including:
- **Security Requirements**: 5 core requirements (Immutability, Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality, Non-repudiation)
- **Compliance Implementation Notes**: Specific guidance for each standard
- **Performance Considerations**: Guidance on efficient logging
- **Method Documentation**: Each trait method includes requirements and compliance notes

### 5. Compliance Reference Guide
New `compliance` module with:
- **GDPR Requirements**: Data minimization, right to erasure, retention periods
- **SOC2 Requirements**: Continuous monitoring, change management, incident response
- **HIPAA Requirements**: Encryption, minimum necessary, 6-year retention
- **PCI DSS Requirements**: Specific events per requirement (10.2.1-10.2.7)
- **ISO 27001 Requirements**: Risk-based approach, corrective actions

### 6. Compliance Matrix
Quick reference table showing which events are required (✓) or recommended (○) for each standard.

### 7. Recommended Configuration
Sample TOML configuration for multi-compliance environments with:
- Retention settings (7 years for maximum compliance)
- Encryption and compression settings
- Alert configurations
- Integrity verification settings

## Key Benefits for Compliance Teams

1. **Clear Mapping**: Each event type shows exactly which compliance standards require it
2. **Retention Guidance**: Specific retention periods for each standard
3. **Required vs Optional**: Clear distinction between mandatory and recommended fields
4. **Regulatory References**: Specific regulation sections cited (e.g., HIPAA §164.312(b))
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Practical advice for meeting each standard's requirements

## Usage for Auditors

Security auditors can now:
1. Verify that all required events are being logged for their standard
2. Check retention policies against requirements
3. Ensure proper severity levels are assigned
4. Validate that required fields are captured
5. Use the compliance matrix for quick verification

## Next Steps for Implementation

Teams implementing this audit system should:
1. Review the compliance matrix to identify required events
2. Configure retention policies based on applicable standards
3. Set up alerts for critical events
4. Implement integrity verification for PCI DSS
5. Test export functionality for regulatory reporting
