## Security-Focused Documentation Highlights

1. **Error Handling**: Every method documents its Result type and possible errors
2. **Security Best Practices**: Each scanning method includes security recommendations
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Documents the balance between security and performance
4. **Configuration Impact**: Clear documentation of how config options affect scanning
5. **Thread Safety**: Explicit documentation of concurrency guarantees
6. **Type Safety**: Emphasis on using enums for security decisions

## Configuration Documentation

The module documentation includes a complete TOML configuration example showing:
- Detection toggles (unicode, injection, XSS)
- Performance limits (max_scan_depth)
- Enhanced mode options
- Custom pattern file support

This comprehensive documentation ensures developers can:
- Understand the security model
- Configure scanning appropriately
- Handle threats based on severity
- Implement proper error handling
- Make informed performance vs security decisions
