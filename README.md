## üõ°Ô∏è What is KindlyGuard?

KindlyGuard is a developer-friendly security server that protects AI systems without getting in your way. Built by developers, for developers, it provides enterprise-grade protection while remaining approachable and easy to use. Instead of cryptic errors and false positives, KindlyGuard offers clear, actionable security insights that help you build safer AI applications.

## üéØ Our Mission

We believe security should be accessible to everyone. KindlyGuard was born from the conviction that developers shouldn't have to choose between robust security and ease of use. By being "kind" in our approach - with clear messages, helpful suggestions, and a focus on protection rather than punishment - we make security a collaborative ally rather than a gatekeeper.

Every developer deserves enterprise-grade security tools. That's why KindlyGuard's core security features will always be open source and free. Because when we all build more secure software, we all win.

## ‚ùì Why KindlyGuard?

### Security That Doesn't Slow You Down
Traditional security tools often feel like roadblocks. KindlyGuard integrates seamlessly into your workflow, providing protection without friction. Our sub-millisecond scanning ensures your AI applications remain responsive while staying secure.

### Clear, Actionable Threat Reports
When KindlyGuard detects a threat, it doesn't just say "blocked." It explains what was found, why it's dangerous, and how to fix it. Every security alert is an opportunity to learn and improve.

### Built on Modern Rust for Safety and Speed
Leveraging Rust's memory safety guarantees and zero-cost abstractions, KindlyGuard delivers enterprise-grade security without the enterprise-grade overhead. No buffer overflows, no data races, just reliable protection.

### Community-Driven Development
Security is a team sport. KindlyGuard thrives on community contributions, from threat pattern updates to feature suggestions. Together, we're building a safer AI ecosystem for everyone.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

KindlyGuard uses a trait-based architecture for maximum flexibility and performance:

```rust
// Clean trait-based API
pub trait SecurityScanner: Send + Sync {
    async fn scan(&self, input: &str) -> Result<Vec<Threat>>;
}

// Multiple implementations available
let scanner = create_scanner(config)?; // Automatic selection
```

### Key Components

- **Scanner Engine** - Modular threat detection system
- **Neutralizer** - Safe content transformation
- **Shield UI** - Real-time threat monitoring
- **Resilience Layer** - Circuit breakers and retry logic
- **Storage Backend** - SQLite persistence with caching

- **VS Code** - Via MCP extensions
- **Cursor** - Native MCP integration
- **Neovim** - Through MCP plugins
- **Zed** - MCP protocol support

### Manual Configuration
If auto-setup doesn't work for your environment:
```bash
# Show configuration in your preferred format
kindly-guard show-mcp-config --format json
kindly-guard show-mcp-config --format yaml
```

### What It Does
Once configured, KindlyGuard:
- Scans all inputs/outputs for security threats
- Provides real-time threat notifications
