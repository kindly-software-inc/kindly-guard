# KindlyGuard Shield Build Report

## Build Environment
- **Date**: 2025-07-02
- **Platform**: Linux 6.12.10-76061203-generic
- **Working Directory**: /home/samuel/kindly-guard/kindly-guard-shield

## Build Status: ❌ Failed

### Missing Dependencies
The build failed due to missing system dependencies required by Tauri v2:

1. **libsoup-3.0** - Required but not installed (only libsoup-2.4 is available)
2. **webkit2gtk-4.1** - Required but not installed (only webkit2gtk-4.0 is available)
3. **javascriptcoregtk-4.1** - Required but not installed

### Installed GTK Dependencies
The following GTK-related packages were found to be installed:
- GTK 3.0 development libraries
- WebKit2GTK 4.0 (version 2.48.3)
- libsoup 2.4 development libraries

### Build Commands Attempted
1. `npm install` - ✅ Successful (6 packages installed)
2. `npm run build` - ❌ Failed due to missing libsoup-3.0
3. `npm run dev` - ❌ Failed (waiting for frontend server that never started)
4. `cargo build` (in src-tauri) - ❌ Failed due to same missing dependencies

### Root Cause
The project is configured to use Tauri v2.0 which requires newer versions of system libraries:
- Tauri v2 requires WebKit2GTK 4.1 (system has 4.0)
- Tauri v2 requires libsoup 3.0 (system has 2.4)

These newer library versions are typically available in more recent Linux distributions (Ubuntu 24.04+) but not in the current Ubuntu 22.04 environment.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Install Missing Dependencies (Requires sudo)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libsoup-3.0-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev
```

### Option 2: Use Docker/Container Build
Create a container with the appropriate dependencies pre-installed.

### Option 3: Downgrade to Tauri v1
Modify the project to use Tauri v1 which is compatible with the older WebKit/libsoup versions.

### Option 4: Build on Compatible System
Build the application on a system with Ubuntu 24.04+ or similar that has the required library versions.

## Project Structure Verified
- ✅ TypeScript/JavaScript source files present
- ✅ Rust source files present with proper module structure
- ✅ Configuration files (tauri.conf.json, package.json, Cargo.toml) present
- ✅ WebSocket test client available for testing

## Testing Capabilities
While the full GUI application cannot be built due to missing dependencies, the following components can still be tested:
- WebSocket server functionality (via test-ws-client.js)
- Core Rust modules (with unit tests)
- Binary protocol implementation
- Shared memory IPC components

## Next Steps
To proceed with building and testing the shield application, one of the recommended options above must be implemented. The most straightforward approach would be Option 1 (installing the missing dependencies) if sudo access is available.
