# Test Status Update

## Current State

After fixing the feature flag conflicts, we now have tests running successfully for the standard configuration:

### Standard Tests (without enhanced features)
- **Server tests**: 104 passed, 4 failed
- **Success rate**: 96.3%

### Failing Tests
1. `neutralizer::security_tests::tests::test_malicious_pattern_handling` - XSS pattern not neutralized
2. `neutralizer::traced::tests::test_traced_neutralization` - Missing span attributes
3. `neutralizer::traced::tests::test_batch_traced_neutralization` - Missing batch attributes
4. `telemetry::distributed::tests::test_probability_sampler` - Sampling count outside expected range

### CLI Tests
- 30 out of 34 tests failing due to "Text file busy" error when executing mock CLI scripts
- This appears to be a test infrastructure issue rather than actual functionality problems

## Next Steps

As noted, we need to create integration tests for both standard and enhanced versions:

1. **Standard Integration Tests**: Test the core security features without proprietary enhancements
2. **Enhanced Integration Tests**: Test the enhanced features when the proprietary core is available
3. **Feature Toggle Tests**: Ensure smooth switching between standard and enhanced modes

## Recommendations

1. Fix the 4 failing server tests first
2. Resolve the CLI test infrastructure issue
3. Create comprehensive integration test suites for both configurations
4. Implement CI/CD matrix testing for both feature sets
