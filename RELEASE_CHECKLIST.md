# Release Checklist for KindlyGuard v1.0

## Quick Release (Automated)

For standard releases, use the automated system:

```bash
# One-command release
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

# With options
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0 --auto-publish  # Skip prompts
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0 --dry-run      # Preview only
```

The automated release handles:
- ✅ Version updates across all files
- ✅ Git commits and tags
- ✅ GitHub Actions triggering
- ✅ Multi-platform builds
- ✅ GitHub release creation
- ✅ Package publishing (with confirmation)
