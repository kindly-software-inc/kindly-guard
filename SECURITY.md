# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in KindlyGuard, please report it to our security team at security@kindlyguard.com. We take all security reports seriously and will respond within 24 hours.

## Code Security Practices

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental disclosure of proprietary implementation details. 

**To install the hooks:**
```bash
./.githooks/install-hooks.sh
```

The hooks will prevent commits containing references to:
- Advanced rate limiting implementations
- Proprietary event buffer designs
- Internal performance metrics
- Patented algorithms

### Continuous Integration

All pull requests are automatically checked for:
- Sensitive content disclosure
- Security vulnerabilities
- License compliance

### Allowed Documentation

Technical details about advanced features should only be documented in:
- `docs/FUTURE_INNOVATIONS.md` - Roadmap features
- Internal documentation repositories
- Patent filings

### Development Guidelines

1. **Keep it Simple**: v1.0 focuses on core security, not optimization
2. **Document Wisely**: Don't reveal implementation secrets in public docs
3. **Test Security**: Always run security tests before committing
4. **Review Carefully**: Have security-sensitive changes reviewed by team
