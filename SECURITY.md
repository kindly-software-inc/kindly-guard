# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in KindlyGuard, please report it through GitHub's Security Advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/samduchaine/kindly-guard/security) in the repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously and will respond within 24 hours.

## Code Security Practices

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental disclosure of proprietary implementation details. 

**To install the hooks:**
```bash
./.githooks/install-hooks.sh
```

The hooks will prevent commits containing references to:
- Advanced rate limiting implementations
- Advanced event buffer designs
- Internal performance metrics
- Patented algorithms

### Continuous Integration

All pull requests are automatically checked for:
- Sensitive content disclosure
- Security vulnerabilities
- License compliance

### Allowed Documentation

Technical details about advanced features should only be documented in:
- `docs/FUTURE_INNOVATIONS.md` - Roadmap features
- Internal documentation repositories
- Patent filings

### Development Guidelines

1. **Keep it Simple**: v1.0 focuses on core security, not optimization
2. **Document Wisely**: Don't reveal implementation secrets in public docs
3. **Test Security**: Always run security tests before committing
4. **Review Carefully**: Have security-sensitive changes reviewed by team

### Dependency Security with cargo-deny

KindlyGuard uses [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) for comprehensive supply chain security. Our policies enforce:

#### Security Advisories
- **Zero tolerance** for known vulnerabilities (RUSTSEC database)
- **Deny** unmaintained crates
- **Warn** on security notices
- Daily automated vulnerability scans

#### License Compliance
- **Allowed licenses**: Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC, CC0-1.0, Unlicense
- **Explicitly denied**: All copyleft licenses (GPL, LGPL, AGPL, MPL)
- All dependencies must be license-compatible with Apache-2.0

#### Banned Crates
- `openssl`, `native-tls` - Use `rustls` for better security
- `reqwest`, `diesel`, `actix-web` - Too heavy for our requirements
- Deprecated crates like `tempdir`, `term`
- Old versions with CVEs (e.g., `time < 0.2`)

#### Source Restrictions
- Only crates.io registry allowed
- No Git dependencies in production
- All sources must be explicitly approved

#### Running Supply Chain Checks
```bash
# Install cargo-deny
cargo install cargo-deny

# Run all checks
cargo deny check

# Run specific checks
cargo deny check advisories  # Security vulnerabilities
cargo deny check licenses    # License compliance
cargo deny check bans        # Banned crates
cargo deny check sources     # Source validation
```

These checks are automatically run:
- On every pull request
- Daily via scheduled GitHub Actions
- As part of the pre-release checklist

### Security Features

KindlyGuard provides comprehensive security protection:

- **Unicode Attack Prevention**: Detects homographs, BiDi overrides, zero-width characters
- **Injection Prevention**: SQL, Command, LDAP, Path traversal protection
- **XSS Protection**: Context-aware HTML/JS/CSS sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection with configurable limits
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of security events

## Compliance
