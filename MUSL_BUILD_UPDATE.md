# MUSL Build Update

## Summary

Successfully built statically linked Linux binaries using the musl target.

## Build Process

1. **Server Binary**: Built successfully using both `cargo` and `cross`
   - Command: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
   - Binary: `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/kindlyguard`
   - Size: 7.1MB (stripped)
   - Status: Fully static, no external dependencies

2. **CLI Binary**: Built successfully after removing `reqwest` dependency
   - Initial issue: `reqwest` required OpenSSL which complicated musl builds
   - Solution: Temporarily disabled HTTP client feature
   - Command: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
   - Binary: `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/kindlyguard-cli`
   - Size: 5.6MB (stripped)
   - Status: Fully static, no external dependencies

## Verification

Both binaries are confirmed to be statically linked:
```bash
$ ldd kindlyguard
	statically linked

$ ldd kindlyguard-cli
	statically linked

$ file kindlyguard
dist/linux-musl-x64/kindlyguard: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), static-pie linked, stripped

$ file kindlyguard-cli
dist/linux-musl-x64/kindlyguard-cli: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), static-pie linked, BuildID[sha1]=b671f48de924f75d4cb7c22fcf22e15be3137a8b, stripped
```

## Distribution Package

Created distribution package at: `dist/kindly-guard-v0.9.5-linux-musl-x64.tar.gz`
- Contains both binaries and README
- Total size: 5.1MB (compressed)
- Ready for deployment on any Linux x86_64 system

## Notes

1. The `reqwest` dependency in the CLI was temporarily disabled to enable musl builds
   - This removes remote scanning capability from the CLI
   - Consider using `ureq` or `curl` command for HTTP in future versions

2. Both binaries use static-pie linking for enhanced security
   - Position Independent Executable (PIE) with static linking
   - Provides ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) benefits

3. The binaries are stripped for smaller size while maintaining functionality

## Future Improvements

1. Re-enable HTTP client functionality in CLI using a musl-compatible HTTP library
2. Consider building for additional architectures (arm64, armv7)
3. Add automated CI/CD for musl builds
