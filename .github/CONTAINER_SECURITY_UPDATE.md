# Container Security Workflow Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the security enhancements made to the GitHub Actions workflows for container management in the KindlyGuard project.

## 1. Updated Existing Workflows

### docker-publish.yml
- ✅ Changed `DOCKER_PASSWORD` to `DOCKER_TOKEN` for consistency
- ✅ Added `id-token: write` permission for OIDC-based signing
- ✅ Added container signing with cosign
- ✅ Container vulnerability scanning was already present with Trivy
- ✅ SBOM generation was already present with Anchore

### docker-multiplatform.yml
- ✅ Already uses `DOCKER_TOKEN` (no change needed)
- ✅ Added `id-token: write` permission for OIDC-based signing
- ✅ Added container signing with cosign
- ✅ Added container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- ✅ Added SBOM generation with Anchore
- ✅ Added security scan result uploads to GitHub Security tab

## 2. New Workflows Created

### ghcr-publish.yml
- Publishes containers to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication (built-in)
- Includes multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)
- Full security scanning pipeline:
  - Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
  - SBOM generation
  - Container signing with cosign
  - Signature verification
  - Build attestation

### container-security-scan.yml
- Scheduled daily security scans at 2 AM UTC
- Scans both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry images
- Comprehensive scanning:
  - Vulnerabilities (OS and libraries)
  - Secrets detection
  - Misconfigurations
  - License compliance
- Automated issue creation for critical findings
- Supports manual triggers with custom image references

### container-security-validation.yml
- Validates Dockerfile security on pull requests
- Checks workflow configurations for security best practices
- Validates:
  - Non-root user configuration
  - No hardcoded secrets
  - Specific version tags (no 'latest')
  - Proper COPY vs ADD usage
  - Consistent secret naming
  - Security scanning presence
  - Container signing configuration

## 3. Additional Configuration

### .hadolint.yaml
- Dockerfile linting configuration
- Enforces security best practices:
  - No switching to root user
  - Proper shell options
  - Package manager cleanup
  - Required OCI labels
  - Security contact information

## Security Improvements

1. **Authentication Consistency**: All Docker Hub workflows now use `DOCKER_TOKEN`
2. **Supply Chain Security**: Container signing with cosign using GitHub OIDC
3. **Vulnerability Management**: Multiple scanners (Trivy, Grype) for better coverage
4. **Transparency**: SBOM generation for all published images
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Daily security scans with automated alerts
6. **Shift-Left Security**: PR validation for Dockerfile changes
7. **Multi-Registry Support**: Both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry

## Required GitHub Secrets

Ensure these secrets are configured in the repository:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token (not password)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Workflow Usage

1. **Regular builds**: Automatically triggered on push to main and tags
2. **Security scans**: Run daily or manually via workflow dispatch
3. **PR validation**: Automatic security checks on Dockerfile changes
4. **Multi-platform builds**: Support for amd64, arm64, armv7, and i386

## Best Practices Enforced

1. All containers must run as non-root user
2. Base images must use specific version tags
3. No hardcoded secrets in Dockerfiles
4. Container images are signed and verifiable
5. Vulnerability scans must pass before publishing
6. SBOM generated for supply chain transparency
7. Security findings are tracked in GitHub Security tab

## Next Steps

1. Configure `DOCKER_TOKEN` in GitHub repository secrets
2. Review and merge these workflow updates
3. Monitor the daily security scans
4. Address any critical vulnerabilities found
5. Consider adding additional security tools as needed
