## Actions Required Before Push

### 1. Fix xtask Compilation Errors
The xtask crate has multiple compilation errors that need to be fixed:
- Missing imports and incorrect struct field usage
- These errors prevent running release automation

### 2. Install cargo-dist
```bash
cargo install cargo-dist --version 0.25.1
```

### 3. Commit Current Changes
```bash
# Review changes first
git diff --staged

# Commit version bump
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.10.0

- Update all package versions to 0.10.0
- Prepare for multi-platform release
- Update changelog with new features"
```

### 4. Create Release Branch (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
git checkout -b release/0.10.0
```

### 5. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# After fixing xtask
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

### 6. Build All Targets Locally (Test)
```bash
# After installing cargo-dist
cargo dist build --artifacts all
```

## Push Sequence

### Phase 1: Push to Repository
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# Or if using release branch
git push -u origin release/0.10.0
```

### Phase 2: Create and Push Tag
```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.10.0 -m "Release v0.10.0

Major features:
- Rebrand to KindlyGuard
- Enhanced security scanners
- Improved performance
- Multi-platform support"

# Push tag
git push origin v0.10.0
```

### Phase 3: Trigger GitHub Release Workflow
The push of the v0.10.0 tag should automatically trigger the release workflow if configured.

### Phase 4: Monitor Release
- Check GitHub Actions for workflow status
- Verify all platform builds succeed
- Ensure artifacts are properly uploaded

## Post-Push Verification
- [ ] GitHub release created with all artifacts
- [ ] npm package published
- [ ] Homebrew formula updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Crates.io package published (if applicable)

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
```bash
# Delete remote tag
git push --delete origin v0.10.0

# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.10.0

# Fix issues and retry
```

## Notes
- The xtask compilation errors MUST be fixed before proceeding
- Consider testing the release process on a separate branch first
- Ensure all CI/CD secrets are properly configured in the repository
